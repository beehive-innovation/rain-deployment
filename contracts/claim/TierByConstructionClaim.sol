/// @title TierByConstructionClaim
/// @notice `TierByConstructionClaim` is a base contract for other contracts to
/// inherit from.
///
/// It builds on `TierByConstruction` with a `claim` function and `_afterClaim`
/// hook.
///
/// The `claim` function checks `onlyTier` and exposes `isTier` for
/// `_afterClaim` hooks so that accounts can self-mint rewards such as erc20,
/// erc1155, erc721, etc. if they meet the tier requirements.
///
/// The `claim` function can only be called once per account.
///
/// Note that `claim` is an unrestricted function and only the tier of the
/// _recipient_ is checked.
///
/// Implementing contracts must be careful to avoid griefing attacks where an
/// attacker calls `claim` against a third party in such a way that their
/// reward is minimised or damaged in some way.
///
/// For example, `ERC20BalanceTier` used with `TierByConstructionClaim` opens
/// the ability for an attacker to `claim` every address they know that has not
/// reached the minimum balance, permanently voiding that address for future
/// claims even if they reach the minimum balance at a later date.
///
/// Another example, `data_` is set to some empty value by the attacker for the
/// `claim` call that voids the ability for the recipient to receive more
/// rewards, had the `data_` been set to some meaningful value.
///
/// The simplest fix is to require `msg.sender` and recipient account are the
/// same, thus requiring the receiver to ensure for themselves that they claim
/// only when and how they want. Of course, this also precludes a whole class
/// of delegated claims processing that may provide a superior user experience.
///
/// Inheriting contracts MUST implement `_afterClaim` with restrictions that
/// are appropriate to the nature of the claim.
///
/// @dev Contract that can be inherited by anything that wants to manage claims
/// of erc20/721/1155/etc. based on tier.
/// The tier must be held continously since the contract construction according
/// to the tier contract.
/// In general it is INSECURE to inherit `TierByConstructionClaim` without
/// implementing `_afterClaim` with appropriate access checks.
