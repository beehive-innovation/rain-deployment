This will revert if this is called before seeder\n///   reserve funds are available on the `Trust`.\n/// - `anonEndDistribution` can be called by anyone (only when\n///   `RedeemableERC20Pool` is in `Phase.TWO`) to end the Dutch Auction\n///   and distribute funds to the correct stakeholders, depending on\n///   whether or not the auction met the fundraising target.\n///   - On successful raise\n///     - seed funds are returned to `seeder` address along with\n///       additional `seederFee` if configured\n///     - `redeemInit` is sent to the `redeemableERC20` address, to back\n///       redemptions\n///     - the `creator` gets the remaining balance, which should\n///       equal or exceed `minimumCreatorRaise`\n///   - On failed raise\n///     - seed funds are returned to `seeder` address\n///     - the remaining balance is sent to the `redeemableERC20` address, to\n///       back redemptions\n///     - the `creator` gets nothing\n/// @dev Mediates stakeholders and creates internal Balancer pools and tokens\n/// for a distribution.\n///\n/// The goals of a distribution:\n/// - Mint and distribute a `RedeemableERC20` as fairly as possible,\n///   prioritising true fans of a creator.\n/// - Raise a minimum reserve so that a creator can deliver value to fans.\n/// - Provide a safe space through membership style filters to enhance\n///   exclusivity for fans.\n/// - Ensure that anyone who seeds the raise (not fans) by risking and\n///   providing capital is compensated.\n///\n/// Stakeholders:\n/// - Creator: Have a project of interest to their fans\n/// - Fans: Will purchase project-specific tokens to receive future rewards\n///   from the creator\n/// - Seeder(s): Provide initial reserve assets to seed a Balancer trading pool\n/// - Deployer: Configures and deploys the `Trust` contract\n///\n/// The creator is nominated to receive reserve assets on a successful\n/// distribution. The creator must complete the project and fans receive\n/// rewards. There is no on-chain mechanism to hold the creator accountable to\n/// the project completion. Requires a high degree of trust between creator and\n/// their fans.\n///\n/// Fans are willing to trust and provide funds to a creator to complete a\n/// project. Fans likely expect some kind of reward or \"perks\" from the\n/// creator, such as NFTs, exclusive events, etc.\n/// The distributed tokens are untransferable after trading ends and merely act\n/// as records for who should receive rewards.\n///\n/// Seeders add the initial reserve asset to the Balancer pool to start the\n/// automated market maker (AMM).\n/// Ideally this would not be needed at all.\n/// Future versions of `Trust` may include a bespoke distribution mechanism\n/// rather than Balancer contracts. Currently it is required by Balancer so the\n/// seeder provides some reserve and receives a fee on successful distribution.\n/// If the distribution fails the seeder is returned their initial reserve\n/// assets. The seeder is expected to promote and mentor the creator in\n/// non-financial ways.\n///\n/// The deployer has no specific priviledge or admin access once the `Trust` is\n/// deployed. They provide the configuration, including nominating\n/// creator/seeder, and pay gas but that is all.\n/// The deployer defines the conditions under which the distribution is\n/// successful. The seeder/creator could also act as the deployer.\n///\n/// Importantly the `Trust` contract is the owner/admin of the contracts it\n/// creates. The `Trust` never transfers ownership so it directly controls all\n/// internal workflows. No stakeholder, even the deployer or creator, can act\n/// as owner of the internals.\ncontract Trust is ReentrancyGuard {\n\n    using Math for uint256;\n\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n    using SafeERC20 for RedeemableERC20;\n\n    /// Anyone can emit a `Notice`.\n    /// This is open ended content related to the `Trust`.\n    /// Some examples:\n    /// - Raise descriptions/promises\n    /// - Reviews/comments from token holders\n    /// - Simple onchain voting/signalling\n    /// GUIs/tooling/indexers reading this data are expected to know how to\n    /// interpret it in context because the contract does not.\n    /// @param sender The `msg.sender` that emitted the `Notice`.\n    /// @param data Opaque binary data for the GUI/tooling/indexer to read.\n    event Notice(address indexed sender, bytes data);\n\n    /// Creator from the initial config.\n    address public immutable creator;\n    /// minimum creator raise from the initial config.\n    uint256 public immutable minimumCreatorRaise;\n    /// Seeder from the initial config.\n    address public immutable seeder;\n    /// Seeder fee from the initial config.\n    uint256 public immutable seederFee;\n    /// Seeder units from the initial config.\n    uint16 public immutable seederUnits;\n    /// Seeder cooldown duration from the initial config.\n    uint16 public immutable seederCooldownDuration;\n    /// Redeem init from the initial config.\n    uint256 public immutable redeemInit;\n    /// SeedERC20Factory from the initial config.\n    SeedERC20Factory public immutable seedERC20Factory;\n    /// Balance of the reserve asset in the Balance pool at the moment\n    /// `anonEndDistribution` is called.
