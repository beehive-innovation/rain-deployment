For example, the DID\n/// (Decentralized Identifiers) specification from W3C outlines that the\n/// controller and the subject of an identity are two different entities.\n///\n/// This is because self-identification is always problematic to the point of\n/// being uselessly unbelievable.\n///\n/// For example, I can simply say \"I am the queen of England\" and what\n/// onchain mechanism could possibly check, let alone stop me?\n/// The same problem exists in any situation where some priviledge or right is\n/// associated with identity. Consider passports, driver's licenses,\n/// celebrity status, age, health, accredited investor, social media account,\n/// etc. etc.\n///\n/// Typically crypto can't and doesn't want to deal with this issue. The usual\n/// scenario is that some system demands personal information, which leads to:\n///\n/// - Data breaches that put individual's safety at risk. Consider the December\n///   2020 leak from Ledger that dumped 270 000 home addresses and phone\n///   numbers, and another million emails, of hardware wallet owners on a\n///   public forum.\n/// - Discriminatory access, undermining an individual's self-sovereign right\n///   to run a full node, self-host a GUI and broadcast transactions onchain.\n///   Consider the dydx airdrop of 2021 where metadata about a user's access\n///   patterns logged on a server were used to deny access to presumed\n///   Americans over regulatory fears.\n/// - An entrenched supply chain of centralized actors from regulators, to\n///   government databases, through KYC corporations, platforms, etc. each of\n///   which holds an effective monopoly over, and ability to manipulate user's\n///   \"own\" identity.\n///\n/// These examples and others are completely antithetical to and undermine the\n/// safety of an opt-in, permissionless system based on pseudonomous actors\n/// self-signing actions into a shared space.\n///\n/// That said, one can hardly expect a permissionless pseudonomous system\n/// founded on asynchronous value transfers to succeed without at least some\n/// concept of curation and reputation.\n///\n/// Anon, will you invest YOUR money in anon's project?\n///\n/// Clearly for every defi blue chip there are 10 000 scams and nothing onchain\n/// can stop a scam, this MUST happen at the social layer.\n///\n/// Rain protocol is agnostic to how this verification happens. A government\n/// regulator is going to want a government issued ID cross-referenced against\n/// international sanctions. A fan of some social media influencer wants to\n/// see a verified account on that platform. An open source software project\n/// should show a github profile. A security token may need evidence from an\n/// accountant showing accredited investor status. There are so many ways in\n/// which BOTH sides of a fundraise may need to verify something about\n/// themselves to each other via a THIRD PARTY that Rain cannot assume much.\n///\n/// The trust model and process for Rain verification is:\n///\n/// - There are many `Verify` contracts, each represents a specific\n///   verification method with a (hopefully large) set of possible reviewers.\n/// - The verifyee compiles some evidence that can be referenced by ID in some\n///   relevant system. It could be a session ID in a KYC provider's database or\n///   a tweet from a verified account, etc. The ID is a `uint256` so should be\n///   enough to fit just about any system ID, it is large enough to fit a hash,\n///   2x UUIDs or literally any sequential ID.\n/// - The verifyee calls `add` _for themselves_ to include their ID under their\n///   account, after which they _cannot change_ their submission without\n///   appealing to someone who can remove. This costs gas, so why don't we\n///   simply ask the user to sign something and have an approver verify the\n///   signed data? Because we want to leverage both the censorship resistance\n///   and asynchronous nature of the underlying blockchain. Assuming there are\n///   N possible approvers, we want ANY 1 of those N approvers to be able to\n///   review and approve an application. If the user is forced to submit their\n///   application directly to one SPECIFIC approver we lose this property. In\n///   the gasless model the user must then rely on their specific approver both\n///   being online and not to censor the request. It's also possible that many\n///   accounts add the same ID, after all the ID will be public onchain, so it\n///   is important for approvers to verify the PAIRING between account and ID.\n/// - ANY account with the `APPROVER` role can review the added ID against the\n///   records in the system referenced by the ID. IF the ID is valid then the\n///   `approve` function should be called by the approver.\n/// - ANY account with the `BANNER` role can veto either an add OR a prior\n///   approval. In the case of a false positive, i.e. where an account was\n///   mistakenly approved, an appeal can be made to a banner to update the\n///   status. Bad accounts SHOULD BE BANNED NOT REMOVED. When an account is\n///   removed, its onchain state is once again open for the attacker to\n///   resubmit a new fraudulent session ID and potentially be reapproved.\n///   Once an account is banned, any attempt by the account holder to change\n///   their session ID, or an approver to approve will be rejected. Downstream\n///   consumers of a `State` MUST check for an existing ban.\n///   - ANY account with the `REMOVER` role can scrub the `State` from an\n///   account. Of course, this is a blockchain so the state changes are all\n///   still visible to full nodes and indexers in historical data, in both the\n///   onchain history and the event logs for each state change. This allows an\n///   account to appeal to a remover in the case of a MISTAKEN BAN or also in\n///   the case of a MISTAKEN ADD (e.g. wrong ID value), effecting a\n///   \"hard reset\" at the contract storage level.\n///\n/// Banning some account with an invalid session is NOT required. It is\n/// harmless for an added session to remain as `Status.Added` indefinitely.\n/// For as long as no approver decides to approve some invalid added session it\n/// MUST be treated as equivalent to a ban by downstream contracts.\n///\n/// Rain uses standard Open Zeppelin `AccessControl` and is agnostic to how the\n/// approver/remover/banner roles and associated admin roles are managed.\n/// Ideally the more credibly neutral qualified parties assigend to each role\n/// for each `Verify` contract the better. This improves the censorship\n/// resistance of the verification process and the responsiveness of the\n/// end-user experience.\n///\n/// Ideally the admin account assigned at deployment would renounce their admin\n/// rights after establishing a more granular and appropriate set of accounts\n/// with each specific role.\ncontract Verify is AccessControl {\n\n    /// Any state never held is UNINITIALIZED.\n    /// Note that as per default evm an unset state is 0 so always check the\n    /// `addedSince` block on a `State` before trusting an equality check on\n    /// any other block number.\n    /// (i.e. removed or never added)\n    uint32 constant public UNINITIALIZED = 0xFFFFFFFF;\n\n    /// Emitted when a session ID is first associated with an account.\n    event Add(address indexed account, uint256 indexed id);\n    /// Emitted when a previously added account is approved.\n    event Approve(address indexed account);\n    /// Emitted when an added or approved account is banned.\n    event Ban(address indexed account);\n    /// Emitted when an account is scrubbed from blockchain state.\n    event Remove(address indexed account);\n\n    /// Admin role for `APPROVER`.\n    bytes32 public constant APPROVER_ADMIN = keccak256(\"APPROVER_ADMIN\");\n    /// Role for `APPROVER`.\n    bytes32 public constant APPROVER = keccak256(\"APPROVER\");\n\n    /// Admin role for `REMOVER`.\n    bytes32 public constant REMOVER_ADMIN = keccak256(\"REMOVER_ADMIN\");\n    /// Role for `REMOVER`.\n    bytes32 public constant REMOVER = keccak256(\"REMOVER\");\n\n    /// Admin role for `BANNER`.\n    bytes32 public constant BANNER_ADMIN = keccak256(\"BANNER_ADMIN\");\n    /// Role for `BANNER`.\n    bytes32 public constant BANNER = keccak256(\"BANNER\");\n\n    // Account => State\n    mapping (address => State) public states;\n\n    /// Defines RBAC logic for each role under Open Zeppelin.\n    constructor (address admin_) {\n        // `APPROVER_ADMIN` can admin each other in addition to\n        // `APPROVER` addresses underneath.\n        _setRoleAdmin(APPROVER_ADMIN, APPROVER_ADMIN);\n        _setRoleAdmin(APPROVER, APPROVER_ADMIN);\n\n        // `REMOVER_ADMIN` can admin each other in addition to\n        // `REMOVER` addresses underneath.\n        _setRoleAdmin(REMOVER_ADMIN, REMOVER_ADMIN);\n        _setRoleAdmin(REMOVER, REMOVER_ADMIN);\n\n        // `BANNER_ADMIN` can admin each other in addition to\n        // `BANNER` addresses underneath.\n        _setRoleAdmin(BANNER_ADMIN, BANNER_ADMIN);\n        _setRoleAdmin(BANNER, BANNER_ADMIN);\n\n        // It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that the `admin_` delegates specific\n        // admin roles then revokes the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and the `X_ADMIN`\n        // roles.\n        _setupRole(APPROVER_ADMIN, admin_);\n        _setupRole(REMOVER_ADMIN, admin_);\n        _setupRole(BANNER_ADMIN, admin_);\n\n        // This is at the end of the constructor because putting it at the\n        // start seems to break the source map from the compiler \n        require(admin_ != address(0), \"0_ACCOUNT\");\n    }\n\n    /// Typed accessor into states.\n    function state(address account_) external view returns (State memory) {\n        return states[account_];\n    }\n\n    /// Derives a single `Status` from a `State` and a reference block number.\n    function statusAtBlock(State calldata state_, uint32 blockNumber)\n        external\n        pure\n        returns (Status)\n    {\n        // The state hasn't even been added so is picking up block zero as the\n        // evm fallback value.
