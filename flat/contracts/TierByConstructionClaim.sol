/// It builds on `TierByConstruction` with a `claim` function and `_afterClaim`

///
/// The `claim` function checks `onlyTier` and exposes `isTier` for
/// `_afterClaim` hooks so that accounts can self-mint rewards such as erc20,
/// erc1155, erc721, etc. if they meet the tier requirements.
///
/// The `claim` function can only be called once per account.
///
/// Note that `claim` is an unrestricted function and only the tier of the

///
/// Implementing contracts must be careful to avoid griefing attacks where an
/// attacker calls `claim` against a third party in such a way that their
/// reward is minimised or damaged in some way.
///
/// For example, `ERC20BalanceTier` used with `TierByConstructionClaim` opens
/// the ability for an attacker to `claim` every address they know that has not
/// reached the minimum balance, permanently voiding that address for future
/// claims even if they reach the minimum balance at a later date.
///
/// Another example, `data_` is set to some empty value by the attacker for the
/// `claim` call that voids the ability for the recipient to receive more
/// rewards, had the `data_` been set to some meaningful value.
